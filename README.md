# BT2201 Task HTML

## Introduction

Just like in last week's workshop you will add some content to a very basic html document. The html document is called 'myfirst.html' and can be found in this repository. 

You can edit the document directly GitHub's web interface if you like. This is a very convenient way of editing the file. If you want to test your files (especially in the future when we've started using PHP) you have to test them on a web server. 

The preferred way of working is to edit the files on your own machine and to then send them to the server from your machine.  

To get the repository to your own machine you can use GitHub Desktop or link your GitHub account to PHPStorm (there are many more ways but these two are very convenient).

## Task

Below is today's task. You have to work with 'myfirst.html', which can be found in the same repository as the text you are currently reading. The task is exactly the same as last week's, but this time we use GitHub.

1. Add a heading with the following text to the html document 

   `My First Heading for BT2201`

   This heading should be a heading of the highest order / the most important heading.

2. Then add a paragraph with the following text to the html document, under the heading

   `My first paragraph for BT2201`

   Make sure you mark it up as a paragraph / use the paragraph tag.
   

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

Commit early, commit often - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. There's no problem if you commit and there's a mistake in your file.
